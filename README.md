One of the many heralds of geekdom is an extremely customized
environment. This is the history of our journey down that path.

We use vim and [Z-Shell](http://www.zsh.org/) as our primary tools for getting things
done. We track our code with [Git](http://git-scm.com/).  Much of that code is
written in [Python](http://www.python.org/) and [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org).

Our many thanks to the wonderful [Cassie Meharry](https://github.com/cassiemeharry/dotfiles/),
whose original dotfiles was a guide.

## WSL installation

To install dotfiles clone the repository and run ./wsl-install

```bash
cd /u
git clone https://github.com/directbuy/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
/bin/bash ./wsl-install
```

## posh installation on local

to install dotfiles, clone the repository and run ./install_posh.ps1

```posh
set-executionpolicy -force -executionpolicy allsigned -scope process

when etting up a server, install much the same way, but use the global flag so that 
dotfiles are made available to all users

```
install_posh.ps1 -global
install_vim.ps1
```
